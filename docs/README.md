# Docs

There are three parts to the documentation:

## 1. Short user documentation

[This](./User-Doc.md) is a short document, detailing how to compile and run each separate part of the compiler.

## 2. UML Class-Diagram for AST

This part consists of the [diagram](./AST-Klassendiagramm.png) itself, as well as a short [description](./Notizen%20zum%20AST.md) to the diagram, explaining decisions behind the chosen structure.

## 3. Detailed Description of our work

[This](./Project-Doc.md) is the most extensive part of the documentation. Here we detail exactly who has done what work on this project.
